Movie ticket sales system.

Problem statement:
------------------

Your goal is to design a Java application that will manage the sales
of movie tickets in a cinema complex. The complex consists of several 
theaters that show movies at different times. The same movie may be showing
in more than one theater. 

The ticket prices may be different for children, adults, and seniors. There
may also be a different price for the matinees. 

The cinema complex wants to be able to analyze its sales by various
criteria - tickets sold to seniors, tickets for a specific movie,
matinee ticket sales, etc.

Some cinema complexes may also have luxury theaters with higher fixed 
price for all patrons.


Use Cases
-----------------------------------------
UC1 Select the movie
UC2 Print out the information  
UC3 Choose specific time and theater
UC4 Purchase the movie
(it gets updated cause, it doesn't make sense to choose a time, choosing movie is better.)

Use Case1
-----------------------------------------
1. Computer lists up movies' names on the screen 

2. User choose one of them, which he/she wants to watch.

Use Case2
-----------------------------------------
1. System prints out all the time and theater(number of seats available) of the chosen movie
 
Use Case3
------------------------------------------
1. User can select which time and theater he wants to pick. 

Use Case4
-------------------------------------------
1. After user picks the movie with the time and theater he wants, 
the system prints out 3 different kinds of tickets with different
price, including children, adults, and seniors. 

2. User choose the corresponding ticket and purchase the tickets 
after system shows the confirm information.


Requirements
-------------
The system should list the movie's with a 
corresponding number for picking.

The system shall allow user to input the number for movies.

The system should print different time and theaters for the chosen movie

the theater should coming with number of seats available

Users should be allowed to choose printed movie with time and theater

After user picks, the system should show different price for children, 
adults and seniors.

User shall be allowed to choose type of tickets and see the confirm page 
and purchase tickets.

Confirm page should include all the information including movie name, time, 
theater, seats available, ticket's type and price.

Manager should be allowed to initialize and update the matches of movie, 
time and theater 


Domains:
--------

User interface: Input module
                Reporting the results of selections

Manager interface(in TicketSeller): Input module for providing initial data
                   Input for updating the information
        
Data manager: module that keeps track of the data, verifies its integrity,
              processes the updates



Relations:
----------

User interface: interacts with the user, provides selection of movie or time,
                interacts with the data manager to get the selection of movie or time,
                reports to the data manager the user's selection of the movie or time,
                receives from the data manager the information about time, price and movie.

Manager interface: Allows the manager to initialize and to modify the information
                   about the movie, time and theater. Interacts with data manager
                   notifying it of any changes in the cinema.

Data manager: Handles all information about the cinema used for providing informations of movies,
              including calculate ending time. Is responsible for integrity of data.



Constraints:
------------
The cinema should allow for at least 3 theaters within the complex,
at least 3 ticket price categories and 3 time slots per theater,
at l east 5 different movies shown.

Data model:
-----------
Cinema: the collection of movies

User: the user interface

movies: the list of providing movies

time: the time slots given as 3 or 4 digits int.

name: the name of a movie given by string
 
theater: the location and its capacity of the movie shown in the cinema. 

Each movie has at least one time with one theater and 3 price categories.
